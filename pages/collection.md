Through a curated sampling of munājāt manuscripts, this digital collection offers a glimpse into a rich tradition. Most manuscript images, sourced from other digital libraries, are in the public domain, though for better visualization and shorter load time, text objects are presented as cover images instead of full-text pdf documents, which interested readers are able to access via links provided in the metadata.
