This digital collection, created by Indiana University Bloomington Comparative Literature Ph.D. Candidate Yilin La, is a work in progress. Objects in the collection, related metadata, interactive features, and individual exhibits will be updated as the corpus expands in volume, language, and medium. Comparative examples of the munājāt genre are intended to promote further research on Islamic ritual and practice, the role of form in the formation of a genre, and the interplay between poetry and prayer. Send Yilin your suggestions, comments, or corrections.
